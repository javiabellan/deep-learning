    "* Understanding the ins and outs of the data plays a large role in being able to interpret behaviors about your model and its performance\n",
    "* Without this we're just throwing a model at data and while we could perform well, you'll be asked *why* and understanding **both** the *data* and the *technique* let's you do so\n",

    "# Understanding the Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* You'll be the expert in neural networks on the team (I've found), so you need to *make sure* what you're telling your team is accurate and reliable information\n",

    "# Understanding how to *Interpret* the Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is especially hard with tabular, as many researchers still view neural networks as black boxes where we can never know what's going on\n",
    "* Understanding how to use the various tools to interpret models for your peers/partners in a way that they can understand is extremely valuable. While we may understand what [ClassConfusion](https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2.0/blob/master/Tabular%20Notebooks/03_ClassConfusion.ipynb), [SHAP](https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2.0/blob/master/Tabular%20Notebooks/03_SHAP.ipynb), etc is doing in the background, it's another set of skills entirely to *communicate* this effectively\n",
